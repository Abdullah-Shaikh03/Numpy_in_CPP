# Numcpp - A Lightweight NumPy Alternative for C++

Numcpp is a lightweight C++ library for numerical computing, inspired by NumPy.  
It provides multi-dimensional array operations, mathematical functions, and linear algebra tools.

## ðŸš€ Features
- âœ… Multi-dimensional arrays
- âœ… Element-wise arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- âœ… Matrix operations (addition, transpose, dot product)
- âœ… Dynamic memory allocation

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation & Compilation
You can compile the project using `g++`:

```sh
g++ examples/example_numcpp.cpp src/numcpp.cpp -o example



```sh Run the programe using 
./example
